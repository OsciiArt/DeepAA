## Change log
+ 2017/12/2 added light model
## Requirements

+ TensorFlow (1.3.0)
+ Keras (2.0.8)
+ NumPy (1.13.3)
+ Pillow (4.2.1)
+ Pandas (0.18.0)
+ Scikit-learn (0.19.0)
+ h5py (2.7.1)
+ model's weight (download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B90WglS_AQWebjBleG5uRXpmbUE) and place it in dir `model`.)
+ training data (additional, download it from  [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L5n5ICrsXtsWkT-aq2et1FTzp-RH3CeS), extract it and place the extracted directory in dir `data`.)
)

## How to use
please change the line 15 of `output.py`

```
image_path = 'sample images/original images/21 original.png' # put the path of the image that you convert.
```
into the path of image file that you use.
You should use a grayscale line image.

then run `output.py`.
converted images will be output at `output/`.

You can select light model by change the line 13, 14  of `output.py` into
```
model_path = "model/model_light.json"
weight_path = "model/weight_light.hdf5"
```
